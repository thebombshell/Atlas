# Pantheon, Atlas and Gaea
Started as a univeristy computer games design project, Pantheon is a c++ framework intending to turn engine for video game development.

Atlas and Gaea are the 2 projects Pantheon has been made for and will continue to grow for, hopefully in time each will be worth their own repository.

## Pantheon
Pantheon intends on exposing a variety of necessary features such as rendering, threading, audio managing, user input and network managing without introducing new dependancies, wrapping up complicated functionality into easy to read and easy to use classes making development of a video game or real-time application easier. 

Currently Pantheon uses SDL, OpenGl (via glew), OpenAl (via OpenAl Soft and Alure) and GLM. SDL, OpenGL and OpenAL don't require inclusion, but GLM is expected in order for pantheon to function.

## Atlas
Atlas is a player vs player asteroids, it has a number of design goals, but for the time being the goal is to have it play and control well, with no significant bugs and acceptable support and convinience of use.

## Current Status
Currently pantheon is in need of a dependancy cleanup and by extension so is atlas, the projects do not run properly on machines without the correct development libraries and do not build at all in release targets.

This project was enlightening in the sense of using my programming skills practically and creating projects I would need to share in place of the typical single machine graphical demo, I have learned many lessons from this and expect to have more success on revisiting.
