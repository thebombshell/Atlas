# Pantheon, Atlas and Gaea
Started as a univeristy computer games design project, Pantheon is a c++ framework intending to turn engine for video game development.

Atlas and Gaea are the 2 projects Pantheon has been made for and will continue to grow for, hopefully in time each will be worth their own repository.

## Pantheon
Pantheon intends on exposing a variety of necessary features such as rendering, threading, audio managing, user input and network managing without introducing new dependancies, wrapping up complicated functionality into easy to read and easy to use classes making development of a video game or real-time application easier. 

Currently Pantheon uses SDL, OpenGl (via glew), OpenAl (via OpenAl Soft and Alure) and GLM. SDL, OpenGL and OpenAL don't require inclusion, but GLM is expected in order for pantheon to function.

## Atlas
Atlas is a player vs player asteroids, it has a number of design goals, but for the time being the goal is to have it play and control well, with no significant bugs and acceptable support and convinience of use.

## Gaea
Gaea is a demonstration of procedural level generation in a sidescrolling platformer, to be used as supporting material for my dissertation.

## Current Status
Pantheon is far from complete and in need of some better idiomatic comformity.

Atlas is at its bare minimum functioning state, it is in need of bolstered game feel.

Gaea is awaiting feature implementation in pantheon, namely sprite renderer and physics component, and is currently non-functional.
