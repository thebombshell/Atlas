## Introduction
The WireframeTDS was started as a year 3 computer games design project. The project is intended to be a programming portfolio and an example of effective prototyping and game design.
The concept as it started was a player versus player asteroids where killing a player makes the attacker larger. The concept is intended to be a simple mechanic that can be achieved in a reasonable prototyping timeframe. Rationale was that a simple yet strong mechanic is easy to teach to players and largely expandable.

## Current State
The project is currently in its infancy with a simple single player asteroids. Future goals of the project are currently local and online multiplayer, further goals may include designing "juiciness" and complimentary mechanics.

## Tools Used
Currently there are only 2 tools in use, Visual Studio Community 2015 with default C++ tool chain and github.
This may change in future, tools wanted are a documentation generator and continuous integrator.

## Depdnancies
Other than dependancies implied by the tool chain, the project currently contains files relating to:
- [freeglut](http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/)
- [glew](http://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [glm](https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.8/index.html)
- [no silly warnings header](https://alfps.wordpress.com/the-no_sillywarnings_please-h-file/)

## Style Conventions
Style conventions are largely based on [C++ Best Practices](https://www.gitbook.com/book/lefticus/cpp-best-practices/details) on gitbook.
